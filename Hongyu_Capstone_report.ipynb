In this Capstone project I will try to use the knowledge we have learned about data analysis and FourSquare neighborhood exploring to tentatively find some potential locations in San Francisco, CA to open my restaurant (where I currently live and work).\n\nSan Francisco, as one of the biggest and most immigration-friendly cities in the United States, has a great diversity in everything, including restaurants, which brings a great challenge for any new restaurant to succeed, or survive. According to online sourse, there are more than 4400 restaurants in San Francisco [1], and how to stand out from the peers will be a brain-storming step before I make any decision and investment. There are two main factors I have in mind in the first place that will be strong determinants, **1) location and 2) cuisine type**\n\n#### Location\nLocation is definitely the **KEY**: population, number of restaurant, relative number of restaurant per capita, safe places, ethinicity composition, all of these will be dependent on location\n\n#### Cuisine type\nCuisine type to me is not as critical as location: if you have a solid basis of potential customer, and your food is tasty, service is excellent, decoration is warm, then any type of food could be a hit. But it is definitely helpful to learn how many competitors you will have after all, and I could make my decision at the least risk. \nThere is pretty interative data visualization inidicating the most common cuisine in SF neighborhood include **Mexican, Chinese, and Americna (Burger)** [2], should I follow this trend? Or should I aovide the competition. \nMoreover, I am Chinese, so Chinese cuisine is the one that I know the most. However, I love all types of food from anywhere around the world, so that might not be a big deal\n\nOne thing to point out is these two factors are actually inter-connected: for example what type of cuisine you decide to work on will not only rely on the current number of competitors in the neighborhood, but also population, especially ethinicity composition of this neighborhood.\n\n### In this project, I will analyze both factors, mainly focusing on location, and the final delivery is expected to be the answer of \"Where to do business, and what type\""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dataset\nNeighborhood information and latitude/longitude information will be needed to explore venues on FourSquare and for data visualization\nThree datasets will be used to perform this initial analysis:\n1.
